# School-Projects

School projects I've worked on since I started at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota. This repository is messy, as I didn't know about github's existence until I dumped all the schoolwork I could find on my computer into this repository. Unfortunately I deleted a lot of things before I started saving them. Future repositories with personal projects will be cleaner and much more organized.
